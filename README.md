# School-Efficiency-Dashboard
This dashboard represents a comprehensive School Performance and Efficiency Analysis, likely designed for educational administrators or government stakeholders to monitor academic outcomes and operational health.

<h1>📌Project Overview </h1>
This project provides a data-driven overview of educational institutions' performance, focusing on student outcomes, teacher reliability, and parental feedback. The dashboard enables stakeholders to identify high-performing grade levels, assess resource allocation (funding vs. performance), and pinpoint subjects requiring curriculum or teaching interventions.

<h2> 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>
The dashboard tracks five primary metrics to gauge institutional health:

- Student to Teacher Ratio (3.2): An exceptionally low ratio, suggesting highly personalized instruction or potential overstaffing.

- Teachers' Attendance Rate (94.8%): High reliability in staff presence, which correlates strongly with student stability.

- Graduation Rate (31.9%): A critical area for concern; despite high attendance and low ratios, less than a third of students are graduating.

- Average Revenue Per Student (59,068): Represents the financial investment or cost-efficiency per pupil.

- Performance Index (59.0): A normalized score representing the overall academic health of the filtered schools.

<h2> 📈 Visualizations & Interpretation </h2>
1. <strong> Passing Rate by Class Level (Bar Chart) </strong> 
This chart displays the academic success rate across different educational stages, from Primary 1 to Senior Secondary 3 (SS3).

Insight: There is a gradual decline in passing rates as students progress to higher levels.

Top Performer: Primary 4 (93.67%).

Lowest Performer: JSS1 (90.54%).

Trend: The consistency across all levels (all above 90%) suggests a stable internal assessment system, though this contrasts sharply with the 31.9% Graduation Rate KPI, indicating a possible "bottleneck" at the final exit exams.

2. <strong> Parent Satisfaction by Subject (Area Chart) </strong
   
A sentiment analysis metric showing how parents perceive the quality of instruction in specific subjects on a scale of 0 to 7.

High Satisfaction: Basic Science (6.6) and Social Studies (6.59) are the most well-regarded.

Lower Satisfaction: Government (6.24) and Math (6.29).

Interpretation: Core STEM subjects (Math) and civic subjects (Government) may require better parent-teacher communication or instructional improvements to meet parental expectations.

<h2> 🛠️ Tech Stack </h2> 
- Data Visualization: Power BI (indicated by the slicer and tile formatting).

- Data Source: Educational Management Information System (EMIS).

- Design Theme: High-contrast Dark Mode for executive presentations.

<h2> 🔍 Filter Capabilities </h2>
The dashboard is highly interactive, allowing users to drill down by:

Demographics: Gender.

Geography: Region, State, and Location (Urban/Rural).

Institutional Details: School Name, Year of Admission, and Funding Level (Private/Public).


💡 Recommendations based on Data
Investigate Graduation Gap: With a 90%+ passing rate in classes but only a 31.9% graduation rate, the school should audit the final qualifying examinations to see where students are dropping off.

Revenue Optimization: Given the very low student-to-teacher ratio (3.2), the school could potentially increase enrollment without hiring new staff to improve the Average Revenue Per Student.


<h1> 📊 Dashboard Page 2: Operational Efficiency & Student Engagement </h1> 
<h2> 📌 Overview </h2>
Page 2 shifts the focus from academic results to the environment in which learning occurs. It evaluates how class sizes, teacher experience, and extracurricular activities impact the "Sustainability KPI" of the institution. 

<h2> 🔑 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2> 
- Teachers' Experience Impact (No Correlation): A statistical finding indicating that, within this dataset, higher years of teacher experience do not directly correlate with improved student outcomes.

- Average Class Size (55.5): The mean number of students per classroom across all subjects.

- % Average Performing Student (12.1%): The percentage of students meeting the "High Performing" benchmark.

- Sustainability KPI (53): A composite score measuring the long-term viability of school operations.

- % Passing Rate (92%): The overall success rate for the current reporting period.

<h2> 📈 Visualizations & Interpretation </h2>  
1. <strong> Extracurricular Participation % by Class Level (Bar Chart): </strong> This chart tracks student involvement in non-academic activities.

Peak Engagement: Senior Secondary 1 (SS1) leads with 30.46% participation.

Lowest Engagement: Senior Secondary 3 (SS3) shows the lowest participation at 25.86%.

Interpretation: Participation tends to drop as students reach final examination years (SS3), likely due to increased focus on academic preparation.

2. <strong> Average Class Size Per Subject (Table): </strong> A breakdown of student density across different disciplines: 

High Density: Science and Social Science subjects like Biology (64.7) and Economics (64.2) have the largest class sizes.

Low Density: Core foundational subjects, such as Math (44.5) and Basic Science (44.4), have significantly smaller class sizes.

Insight: The school appears to prioritize smaller groups for core STEM subjects while allowing larger cohorts for electives.

3. <strong> Top Performance by Class Level (Table): </strong Displays the distribution of "Average Performing Students" across grade levels.

Primary Levels: Performance is highest in Primary 2 (14%) and Primary 5/1 (13%).

Secondary Levels: Performance dips in the Senior Secondary years, hovering around 11-12%.

<h2> 💡 Operational Recommendations </h2> 
- Class Size Rebalancing: Subjects like Biology and Economics are significantly above the 55.5 average. To maintain quality, consider splitting these into multiple sections.

- Addressing the "Experience Gap": Since teacher experience shows "No Correlation" with impact, the administration should review teaching methodologies or professional development programs rather than relying solely on seniority.

- Performance Stagnation: The low percentage of "Average Performing Students" (12.1%) suggests that while 92% of students are "passing," very few are reaching high-performance benchmarks. A "Gifted and Talented" program could help move students from passing to excelling.

- Subject Focus: Address the downward trend in parental satisfaction for Mathematics and Government through targeted workshops or curriculum reviews.
